Control statements in C++ are used to control the flow of execution of a program. They are used to alter the sequence in which statements are executed based on certain conditions. There are three types of control statements in C++:

``` {glossary}

Condition Statements
  perform different actions based on a condition. In C++, conditional statements include if, if-else, and switch statements

Iterative Statements
  used to execute a set of statements repeatedly until a condition is met. In C++, looping statements include for, while, and do-while statements

Jump Statements
  transfer control of a program to a different part of the program. In C++, jump statements include break, continue, and goto statements.

```

Using these control statements, C++ programmers can create complex programs that can perform different actions based on certain conditions and can execute the same set of statements repeatedly until a condition is met.
