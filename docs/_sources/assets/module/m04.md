## Overview

``` {card}
Searching and sorting are two fundamental operations in computer science, used to organize and retrieve data efficiently.
```

### Searching

```` {card}
Searching is the process of finding a specific value in a collection of data. Common searching algorithms include:

``` {glossary}

Linear search
  A simple algorithm that sequentially checks each element of the collection until the target value is found. This algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n)$ in the worst case.

Binary search
  A more efficient algorithm that divides the collection in half and compares the target value to the middle element. This process is repeated until the target value is found or the collection is exhausted. This algorithm has a time complexity of $O(log\ n)$ in the worst case, making it much faster than linear search for large collections.

### Sorting

```` {card}
Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending order. Common sorting algorithms include:

``` {glossary}

Insertion sort
  An algorithm that builds the sorted collection one element at a time, by comparing each element with the previous elements and inserting it into the correct position. This algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in the worst case.

Merge sort
  A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the collection in half, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together. This algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n\ log\ n)$ in the worst case, making it much faster than bubble and insertion sort for large collections.

Quick sort
  A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the collection into elements smaller and larger than the pivot, and then recursively sorts the smaller and larger partitions. This algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in the worst case, but can be optimized to have an average time complexity of $O(n\ log\ n)$.

Bubble sort
  A simple algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the collection is sorted. This algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in the worst case.

### Data structures

``` {card}
Data structures play a crucial role in both searching and sorting algorithms, as they determine the efficiency and complexity of the algorithms. Common data structures used for searching and sorting include arrays, linked lists, binary search trees, and heaps.

Overall, understanding searching and sorting algorithms and their associated data structures is essential for computer scientists and programmers, as they are fundamental concepts used in many applications, including databases, web development, and machine learning.
