## Overview

Linear data structures are data structures that follow a sequential or linear order, where each element has a specific position or index. Some of the most common linear data structures include arrays, lists, queues, and stacks.

Arrays
  Arrays are a basic data structure consisting of a contiguous block of memory that stores a collection of elements of the same type. Elements in an array can be accessed by their index, making it easy to access and manipulate data. Common operations on arrays include inserting and deleting elements, sorting, and searching.

Linked Lists
  Linked lists are a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists can be used to implement dynamic data structures and are useful for representing graphs and trees.

Queues
  A queue is a data structure that follows the "first in, first out" (FIFO) principle, where elements are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front. Queues are often used in operating systems and computer networks to manage tasks and requests.

Stacks
  A stack is a data structure that follows the "last in, first out" (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the top of the stack. Stacks are often used in programming languages to manage function calls and memory allocation.

Priority Queues
  A priority queue is an abstract data type that operates similar to a queue, but with each element having a priority assigned to it. Elements with higher priority are dequeued first, regardless of their order of insertion. It is often implemented using a heap data structure, which provides efficient insertion and removal of the highest-priority element. Priority queues are commonly used in algorithms related to scheduling, shortest path finding, and data compression, among others.

Overall, linear data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and are used in a wide range of applications, from data analysis to web development. Understanding the properties, use cases, and associated algorithms of linear data structures is crucial for computer scientists and programmers.
