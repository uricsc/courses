## Definition

> a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation, and produce output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.
>
> In simple terms, a function is a block of code that only runs when it is called.
