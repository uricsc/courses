``` {card} TL;DR
Sorting is a fundamental problem in computer science, and it involves arranging a collection of data in a specific order. There are various sorting algorithms available that can be used to sort data in ascending or descending order based on a specific criterion.

Some of the most basic sorting algorithms include:

Bubble Sort
: It is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.

Insertion Sort
: It is a simple sorting algorithm that works by inserting each element in its proper place in a sorted sub-array. This algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ but performs better than bubble sort for small data sets.

Selection Sort
: It is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from an unsorted sub-array and swaps it with the first element of the sub-array. This algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.

Merge Sort
: It is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively divides the input array into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges them back together. This algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n\ log\ n\)$.

Quick Sort
: It is also a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that picks a pivot element and partitions the array around it. This algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n\ log\ n)$ on average but can degrade to $O(n^2)$ in the worst-case scenario.

Each sorting algorithm has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of time and space complexity, stability, adaptability, and implementation complexity. Understanding and comparing the different sorting algorithms is an important skill for anyone studying data structures and algorithms as it enables them to select the best algorithm for their use case.

```


``` {dropdown} $Number\ of\ comparisons?\ |\ Number\ of\ exchanges?$

In the above snippet, the selection sort algorithm is implemented. The number of comparisons and exchanges made depend on the size of the input array `n`.

For comparisons, there are two nested `for`-loops that compare all elements of the array. The outer `for`-loop, which runs from $i = 0$ to $n - 1$, runs `n` times. The inner `for`-loop, which runs from $j = i + 1$ to $n - 1$, runs $n - i - 1$ times. Therefore, the total number of comparisons is:

$$(n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ... + 1 = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$

For exchanges, each iteration of the outer `for`-loop swaps the element at index i with the element at index min. Since this occurs `n` times, the total number of exchanges is `n`.

``` {dropdown} Notes

Selection Sort: moves through each element finding the minimum value and replacing the current element value as it goes.

$$A[0] \rightarrow A [1] \rightarrow A[2] \rightarrow A[n - 1]$$

- sorted portion left order, fixed, untouched
- unsorted iterated through to find remaining min value to swap current element value
