``` {card} TL;DR

Merge sort is a popular sorting algorithm that works by recursively dividing an array into two halves until each half contains only one element, and then merging the two halves in a sorted manner. The algorithm divides the array in half, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the two sorted halves.

The key idea behind merge sort is that it's easier to sort two smaller sorted arrays than to sort one large unsorted array. As a result, merge sort can achieve a better time complexity than some other sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort or insertion sort.

The time complexity of merge sort is $O(n\ log\ n)$ in the worst case, where n is the number of elements to be sorted. This makes merge sort one of the most efficient comparison-based sorting algorithms, and it's widely used in practice.

```` {card} Breakdown (generalization)
A merge sort consists of several passes over the input.  

$1^{st}$ Pass: merges segments of size 1  
$2^{nd}$ Pass: merges segments of size 2  
$i^{th}$ Pass: merges segments of size $2^{i-1}$.  
Total number of passes: $log\ n$  

As merge showed, we can merge two sorted segments in linear time, which means that each pass takes $O(n)$ time. 
Since there are $log\ n$ passes, the total computing time is $\Theta(n\ log\ n)$, or expressed as:

$$T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}{2}) + \Theta(n)$$

Total time for $mergeSort$ is: the sum of the merging times for all the levels  
- If there are $l$ levels in the tree, then the total merging time is $l * cn$  
- Where $l$ is the number of subproblem levels until subproblems reach size $n$  
For total time, we end up with:

$$cn(log\ n + 1)$$

$$\Theta(n\ log\ n)$$

### Comments on Merge Sort

`````````` {div} full-width
``````` {grid}
``````  {grid-item-card}
``` {admonition} Advantages
:class: seealso

- relatively efficient for sorting large datasets
- stable sort : the order of elements with equal values is preserved during the sort
- easy to implement
- useful for external sorting
- requires relatively few additional resources (such as memory)
``````
``````  {grid-item-card}
``` {admonition} Disadvantages
:class: danger

- slower compared to the other sort algorithms for smaller tasks
- requires an additional memory space of 0(n) for the temporary array
- regardless of sort status, goes through whole process
- requires more code to implement
```

A sorting algorithm is *_stable_* if it preserves the order of equal elements

Consider sorting (in ascending order) a list $A$ into a sorted list $B$. Let $f(i)$ be the index of element $A[i]$ in $B$. The sorting algorithm is stable if:

for any pair $(i,j)$ such that $A[i] = A[j]$ and $i < j$, then $f(i) < f(j)$

### Stability

`````````` {div} full-width
````` {card}

``` {dropdown} Is selection sort stable?
Selection sort algorithm picks the minimum and swaps it with the element at current position.

Suppose the array is:

$$[5,\ 2,\ 3,\ 8,\ 4,\ 5,\ 6]$$

$$[5_a,\ 3,\ 4,\ 5_b,\ 2,\ 6,\ 8]$$

- After iteration 1:
  - 2 will be swapped with the element in 1st position:

- So our array becomes:

$$[2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 5_b,\ 5_a,\ 6,\ 8]$$

- Since now our array is in sorted order and we clearly see that $5_a$ comes before $5_b$ in initial array but not in the sorted array.

- Therefore, selection sort is not stable.

<b class="red">NOT</b> STABLE
```
- long distance swaps
- try: 5 2 3 8 4 5 6

``` {dropdown} Is insertion sort stable?
