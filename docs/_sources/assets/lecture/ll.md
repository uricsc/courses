``` {card} TL;DR
A linked list is a data structure in computer science that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

Unlike arrays, where the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, the nodes in a linked list can be scattered throughout the memory. This makes linked lists more flexible than arrays, as they can be easily modified by adding, removing or rearranging the nodes.

Linked lists come in different types, such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. In a singly linked list, each node has a reference to only the next node in the sequence. In a doubly linked list, each node has references to both the previous and the next nodes in the sequence. In a circular linked list, the last node in the sequence has a reference to the first node, thus forming a circular chain.

Linked lists are commonly used in programming for various purposes, such as implementing dynamic data structures, like stacks, queues, and hash tables, and for managing memory allocation and deallocation in operating systems. However, linked lists can be less efficient than arrays for certain operations, such as random access and searching, as they require traversing the list sequentially from the beginning.

```` {admonition} How are lists implemented in CPython

CPython‚Äôs lists are really variable-length arrays, not Lisp-style linked lists. The implementation uses a contiguous array of references to other objects, and keeps a pointer to this array and the array‚Äôs length in a list head structure.

This makes indexing a list $a[i]$ an operation whose cost is independent of the size of the list or the value of the index.

When items are appended or inserted, the array of references is resized. Some cleverness is applied to improve the performance of appending items repeatedly; when the array must be grown, some extra space is allocated so the next few times don‚Äôt require an actual resize.

Arrays, vectors, forward lists, and lists are all data structures used in computer science and programming to store collections of data. Each of these data structures has its own strengths and weaknesses, and understanding the differences between them can help you choose the best one for your particular application.

``` {glossary}
Array
  a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. The elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, making it easy to access them using an index. Arrays are efficient when you know the size of the data in advance, and you need to access the elements randomly.

Vector
  a dynamic array that can grow or shrink as needed. It is similar to an array, but it can change its size dynamically during runtime. The elements of a vector are stored in contiguous memory locations, making it easy to access them using an index. Vectors are useful when you don't know the size of the data in advance, or when you need to insert or delete elements from the middle of the collection.

Forward List
  a singly linked list that stores a sequence of elements. Each element in a forward list contains a pointer to the next element in the list, but not to the previous one. This means that you can only traverse a forward list in one direction. Forward lists are useful when you need to insert or delete elements from the beginning or middle of the collection, but not the end.
  
List
  a doubly linked list that stores a sequence of elements. Each element in a list contains a pointer to the next and previous elements in the list, allowing you to traverse the list in both directions. Lists are useful when you need to insert or delete elements from any position in the collection, or when you need to maintain a sorted collection.
```

In summary, arrays and vectors are best for situations where you need random access to elements and the size of the collection is known in advance. Forward lists and lists are better for situations where you need to insert or delete elements from the beginning, middle, or end of the collection, or when you need to maintain a sorted collection.

`````     {grid-item-card}
:columns: 6

**Stack Allocation**

When an array is declared as a local variable inside a function without using the new operator, the memory for the array is allocated on the stack. The size of the array must be known at compile-time. Here's an example:

``` {code-block} cpp
void foo() {
    int myArray[10]; // allocate 10 integers on the stack
    // ...
}
```

Stack allocation is fast and efficient, but the size of the array is limited by the available stack space, which is typically smaller than the heap.
`````
`````     {grid-item-card}
:columns: 6

**Heap Allocation**

When an array is declared using the new operator, the memory for the array is allocated on the heap. The size of the array can be determined at runtime. Here's an example:

``` {code-block} cpp
void bar() {
    int* myArray = new int[10]; // allocate 10 integers on the heap
    // ...
    delete[] myArray; // free the memory when done
}
```

Heap allocation is more flexible than stack allocation, but it's slower and more prone to memory leaks if the programmer forgets to free the memory when done.

It's important to note that C++ also provides a number of container classes, such as `std::vector`, `std::list`, and `std::array`, which provide more advanced memory management capabilities than plain C-style arrays.

``````     {grid}
`````     {grid-item-card}
:columns: 6

In C++, `std::vector` is a dynamic container that is implemented as a wrapper around a dynamically-allocated array. The memory for a std::vector is allocated on the heap, and it grows or shrinks dynamically as elements are added or removed.

When a `std::vector` is created, it allocates a block of memory on the heap to hold the elements of the vector. The size of this block of memory is determined by the vector's capacity, which is the maximum number of elements that the vector can hold without allocating more memory. By default, a vector's capacity is 0, and it grows dynamically as elements are added.

When a `std::vector` is resized (by calling `resize()` or by inserting or erasing elements), it may need to allocate more memory on the heap. To avoid reallocating memory too often, which can be expensive, a `std::vector` typically over-allocates by reserving more memory than it needs. The amount of over-allocation is implementation-dependent, but it is usually at least enough to double the capacity of the vector.

Here's an example of creating and using a `std::vector`:

:emphasize-lines:

#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v; // create an empty vector
    v.reserve(10); // reserve space for 10 integers (but size is still 0)

    // add some elements to the vector
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        v.push_back(i); // append an element to the vector
    }

    // iterate over the elements of the vector
    for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) {
        std::cout << *it << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

```

In this example,
- the `std::vector` is created with a default capacity of 0
- `reserve()` is called to allocate space for 10 integers on the heap
- `push_back()` is called to add elements to the vector
  - the vector grows dynamically as needed
- elements of the vector are iterated over using a forward iterator

In C++, `std::forward_list` is a dynamic container that is implemented as a singly linked list. Each element in the list is stored in a separate node on the heap, and each node contains a pointer to the next node in the list.

```` {card}
Think about making **insertions** and **deletions** efficiently...

``` {admonition} What is the computational cost of inserting or deleting 1 element?
:class: dropdown tip

In C++, arrays are fixed-size data structures, which means that the size of the array is determined at the time of declaration and cannot be changed afterwards. Therefore, inserting or deleting elements in an array requires shifting the existing elements to create or close gaps.

Here are the computational costs of inserting and deleting from the rear, front, and at an index of an array:

- Inserting or deleting from the **rear** of an array takes constant time $O(1)$
  - only requires updating the index of the last element in the array.

- Inserting or deleting from the **front** of an array takes linear time $O(n)$ where `n` is the number of elements in the array
  - requires shifting all existing elements by one position to make room for the new element or to close the gap left by the deleted element.

- Inserting or deleting at an arbitrary **index** of an array takes linear time $O(n)$, where `n` is the number of elements in the array
  - requires shifting all elements from the insertion or deletion index to the end of the array by one position to create or close gaps.

*Note that in addition to the computational costs, inserting or deleting from an array also incurs memory costs, as the size of the array may need to be adjusted to accommodate the new or deleted elements. Also, if the array is dynamically allocated, memory allocation and de-allocation costs may apply.*

- Check if the list is empty
- Change the head node to the new node
- If not then traverse till the last node
- Assign the last node‚Äôs next pointer to this new node
- Now, the new node has become the last node.

```` {admonition} Pseudocode

``` {figure} https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220817185024/CircularSinglyLinkedList.png
```

``` {code-block} cpp
:lineno-start: 1
:emphasize-lines:

// Define a Node class to represent each node in the circular singly-linked list
class Node {
public:
    T data; // data stored in the node
    Node* next; // pointer to the next node in the list

    // constructor to initialize a new node with the given data and next pointer
    Node(T data, Node* next = nullptr) {
        this->data = data;
        this->next = next;
    }
};

// Define the CircularSinglyLinkedList class to represent the circular singly-linked list

public:
    // constructor to initialize an empty list with a null tail pointer
    CircularSinglyLinkedList() {
        tail = nullptr;
    }
};

```

Note a circular singly-linked list has the following built-in functions:

- `empty()`: returns true if the list is empty, false otherwise.
- `size()`: returns the number of elements in the list.
- `push_front(const T& value)`: inserts a new node with the given value at the front of the list.
- `pop_front()`: removes the first node from the list.
- `front()`: returns a reference to the data stored in the first node of the list.
- `insert_after(Node* position, const T& value)`: inserts a new node with the given value after the node pointed to by position.
- `erase_after(Node* position)`: removes the node after the node pointed to by position.
- `clear()`: removes all nodes from the list.
- `rotate()`: rotates the list by moving the first element to the end of the list.
