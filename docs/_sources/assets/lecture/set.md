```` {card} TL;DR
A set data structure is an abstract data type that stores a collection of unique elements in a specific order. The primary characteristic of a set is that it does not allow duplicate elements, meaning that each element in the set is unique. Sets are often used when the presence or absence of an element in a collection is the primary concern rather than the order or frequency of elements.  

Key features and properties of a set data structure include:

``` {glossary}

Uniqueness  
  Sets store only unique elements. When attempting to add a duplicate element, it is not added to the set, ensuring that each element appears only once.

Ordering
  Sets can be either ordered or unordered, depending on the implementation. Ordered sets maintain the elements in a sorted order, while unordered sets do not guarantee a specific order.

Fast membership test
  Sets provide efficient membership test operations. Given an element, you can quickly check whether it exists in the set or not.

Dynamic resizing
  Sets can dynamically grow or shrink in size to accommodate elements. The internal implementation manages the memory allocation and resizing as needed.

Operations
  Sets typically support operations such as insertion of elements, deletion of elements, checking membership, and iterating over the elements.

```

Sets can be implemented using various underlying data structures, including balanced binary search trees (such as Red-Black Trees or AVL Trees) or hash tables. These implementations allow for efficient insertion, deletion, and searching operations.

Sets find applications in various scenarios, such as maintaining a collection of unique values, counting unique occurrences of items, or performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

Overall, a set data structure provides a convenient and efficient way to store a collection of unique elements while supporting important operations like insertion, deletion, and membership testing.
