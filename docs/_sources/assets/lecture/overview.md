Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that deal with the organization and manipulation of data.

A data structure is a way of storing and organizing data in a computer program so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. Some common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

An algorithm is a set of instructions or procedures that a computer follows to solve a problem or perform a task. Algorithms are used to manipulate data in various ways, such as searching for specific information, sorting data, or performing mathematical operations.

Together, data structures and algorithms are essential tools for designing efficient and effective computer programs. By understanding how to choose the right data structure and algorithm for a specific task, developers can optimize the performance of their programs and improve their ability to handle large amounts of data.

CSC 212 is at the center of the image for a reason: passing this course is the 'key to the kingdom'...
It's the last of the foundational courses and opens up the rest of the field. Hence why a firm grasp of this material is essential to be successful later...academically and career path...

This many hits denotes two things:
1. There is an impossible amount of information out there on the subject
1. When results fall in the ballpark of 20 million results, it's safe to safe it may be a topic worth understanding well...

```` {card} Facts

- Data Structures & Algorithms courses tend to have a lower success rate than many of their counterparts. This is the nature of the subject matter being difficult to grasp.

- Traditionally, these courses have about a 3:1 fail rate, meaning nearly 33% of students who enroll fail the course.
