## [Overview]()

`````````` {div} full-width

``` {admonition} Definition
:class: seealso

> Jump statements are control flow statements used in programming languages to alter the normal sequence of execution. These statements allow programmers to control the flow of their code by transferring control to different parts of the program based on certain conditions

```

````` {admonition} Use Cases
:class: tip

```` {grid}
```  {grid-item} 
:columns: 4

`break`
: Terminates the innermost loop or switch statement and transfers control to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
```
```  {grid-item} 
:columns: 4

`continue`
: Skips the remaining statements in the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration.
```
```  {grid-item} 
:columns: 4

`goto`
: Unconditionally transfers control to a specified label within the current function.

```

````
`````




````````` {admonition} Pros & Cons
:class: warning

```````` {grid}
```````  {grid-item}

```` {card} üëç

``` {dropdown} Concise Controls [All]
`break` and `continue` statements provide a concise way to control loops and switch statements, improving code readability and efficiency.
```
``` {dropdown} Flexible Flow [C++]
The `goto` statement, although controversial, allows for flexible control flow in certain situations.
```
``` {dropdown} Passing Values [Python]
The `return` statement allows functions to pass values back to the caller.
```
``` {dropdown} Exit Flow [Rust & Go]
The `return` statement allows functions to exit early and return values.
```
````
```````
```````  {grid-item}


```` {card} üëé
``` {dropdown} Overuse & Misuse [All]
Overusing `break`, `continue`, or `goto` statements can make code harder to read and understand, leading to potential bugs and maintenance issues, as well as unexpected behavior and infinite loops.


```
``` {dropdown} Spaghetti Code [C++]
The `goto` statement can create spaghetti code and make the program harder to maintain and debug.
```
``` {dropdown} Convoluted Logic [Rust & Go]
Relying too heavily on `return` statements may result in convoluted program logic and reduced maintainability.
```

The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and iteration.
