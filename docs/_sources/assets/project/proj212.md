# 212 Project

``` {figure} https://techworm.net/programming/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pic.png
```

## Breakdown

```` {card}
In groups of 3-4 members you will research and evaluate a data structure / algorithm not covered in the course material. It will be your task to find a meaningful, unique application for your project.

The project is broken out into three separate aspects:

- Source Code
- Class Presentation
- Project Report

Each aspect will have specific requirements to meet to successfully complete the project overall.
````

## Source Code

```` {card} Code Repository

- Your code from start to finish will live on GitHub.
  - Each group member must be connect via their own github account to a primary account which will be used for submission.
  - Individual contributions must be clear within the '[commits](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits?apiVersion=2022-11-28)' of the repo.

````

```` {card} Code Organization

- Your code must adhere to a [best practice standard of programming](https://codesigningstore.com/ultimate-programming-best-practices-guide)...
- All code to be evaluated must be included in the repo prior to final submission and saved with appropriate file extentions.

````

```` {card} Code Compiliation

- EXPLICIT DEPENDENCIES AND INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO COMPILE YOUR CODE ARE REQUIRED!! Your code will not be graded without these directly outlined in a README within your repo
- Incomplete and or non-working project code may still earn partial credit

````

## Presentation

```` {card} ~15 Minutes

- Each group will be alotted 15 minutes to present. Working as a group it will be your responsibility to keep track of your time. Groups will be cut off at exactly 15 minutes. So please practice your presentations to maximize your time. A possible breakout of time may be:
  - explain your topic, structure / algorithm {~8 mins}
  - review source code (compiling and plots) {~4 mins}
  - answer questions {~3min}
- Slides should be used to express key points and give the audience a focal point for conceptual information
- Your project code should be used for practical demostration

````

```` {card} Partial Credit

- May be recieved for incomplete/non-working projects where deep understanding of the data structure / algorithm is proven

````

## Report

```` {card} Substance

Must include the following:

- Title Page
  - group members
  - project topic with concentration
  - date
- Table of Contents
  - headings
  - subheadings

  - introduction to your topic
    - context & purpose
    - surface level detail

    - what is it
    - why did you choose it
    - how does it mesh with your topic
  - methods
    - explain the data structure / algorithm in depth
      - deeper thinking details
  - implementation
    - describe your work
    - highlight portions of code to address
    - proofs (if you code is working)
      - include input scenarios
      - actual outputs from your code
      - detailed descriptions
  - contributions
    - create a table with each members contributions
    - _note: contributions should be verifiable via GitHub_
- Conclusion
  - wrap up findings from research
  - wrap up findings from your programming
  - formalize any other conclusions or predictions you can make relative to the topic and ways it may be used in the world

````

```` {card} Partial Credit

- May be granted to incomplete projects if the report includes sound, relevant information regardless of progress
````

## Submission

```` {card}

Source Code
: Gradescope: submit only the link to your group's primary project repository

Presentation
: Gradescope: slides (must be converted to PDF prior to submission)

Report
: Gradescope: submit as a PDF

**_Note: any portion missing from the Gradescope submission will not be graded..._**

````

## Grading

```` {card} Rubric

Presentation

Group #  

```{list-table}

* - 
  - 0: No Credit
  - 2: Poor
  - 4: Acceptable
  - 7: Good
  - 10: Exceptional
* - *Subject Knowledge* 
  - 
  - Goal of research unclear, information included that does not support research claims in any way.
  - There is a great deal of information that is not clearly integrated or connected to the research.
  - Sufficient information with many good points made, uneven balance and little consistency.
  - An abundance of material clearly related to the research is presented. Points are clearly made and evidence is used to support claims
* - *Organization*
  - 
  - Audience cannot understand presentation because there is no sequence of information.
  - Audience has difficulty following presentation because the presentation jumps around and lacks clear transitions.
  - Information is presented in logical sequence which audience can follow.
  - Information is presented in a logical and interesting sequence which audience can follow. Flows well.
* - *Communication*
  - Presentation could not be followed
  - Information is unclear/muddied but engaging
  - X
  - Communicates subject matter well but fails to engage the audience
  - Connects and engages the audience to bring subject to life
* - *Length*
  - Too long or too short; ten or more minutes above or below allotted time.
  - Within six minutes of allotted time +/-
  - Within four minutes of allotted time +/-.
  - X
  - Within two minutes of allotted time +/-.
