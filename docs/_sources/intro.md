``` {card} Words of Wisdom from Bjarne Stroustrup

> “If you think it's simple, then you have misunderstood the problem.” 

> “There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.” 

> “C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off.” 

> “C++ is designed to allow you to express ideas, but if you don't have ideas or don't have any clue about how to express them, C++ doesn't offer much help.” 

> “Programming is like sex: It may give some concrete results, but that is not why we do it.” 

> “Choosing the right precision for a problem where the choice matters requires significant understanding of floating-point computation. If you don't have that understanding, get advice, take the time to learn, or use double and hope for the best.”
