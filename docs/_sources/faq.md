## Projects

The presentation should provide:

 - speak to the design of your code: what did you use, why did you use is
 - compile and explain the output
- time for questions

*Some formal visualization should be used and able to be submitted with your project.*

Your group will be allocated a 15 minute window to present your project. How you choose to use this time is up to you. Assuming a minute to set up and 1-2 minutes of questions, the presentation itself should be approximately 12-13 minutes. Under 11 minutes or over 15 minutes will result in lost credit.
