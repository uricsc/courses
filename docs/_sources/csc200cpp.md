#### Course Communication

```{card}
ALL course communication is to be done via **EdStem**. Do not e-mail me or any of the TAs and expect a response. General questions should be made publicly so the entire course may benefit from them,and personal questions or partial solutions should be made privately to the staff. If you have a sensitive topic you need to discuss with me away from the TAs, e-mail me and ping me on EdStem to ensure I see it.
```

### Course Objectives

```{card}

- Understand the core aspects of reading/writing code
- Primitive data types
- Variable assignments & operations
- Program control flow
- Control structures & loops
- Simple data structures
- Functions
- Classes & Objects
- Understand the basic principles of programming in C++
- Implement simple algorithms to solve a variety of problems
```

### Action Items

```{card} Term Project
Term project incorprates the combination of all subject matter from the course. This is used as the ultimate practical for understanding, comprehension, and overall ability for implementation. The project will be completed in groups of 3-4 members to be presented to the class in Week 14. 
```

```{card} Labs
Labs are a practical application of the material learned each week. Labs are somewhat scaffolded throughout the term in the respect they will grow and incorporate prior weekly materials. Labs are to be completed the lab session and submitted before leaving. Credit will not be granted to submissions outside of this window.
```

```{card} Assignment
A practical attempt at code spanning multiple weeks of the course. This is not meant to be difficult but merely to give some practical experience with prior concepts as the term moves forward.
```

```{card} Final Exam
A cumulative exam spanning the duration of the term.
```

- Missed deliverables cannot be made up.
- Extensions will be handled on an individual basis, but are typically reserved for special cases. Contact me as soon as possible if any extraneous circumstances arise.
```

```{card} Attendance
While there are no set meeting times for lecture, you will have a mandated lab section each week. You are expected to keep up with the weekly lecture materials and labs. Do not fall behind!
```

``` {card} Course Modifications
I reserve the right to alter, update, modify, and/or remove material from this course as I deem necessary to meet the requirements of and continuous flow the course.
```

### University Policies

```{card} Disability, Access, and Inclusion Services for Students Statement
Your access in this course is important. Please send me your Disability, Access, and Inclusion (DAI) accommodation letter early in the semester so that we have adequate time to discuss and arrange your approved academic accommodations. If you have not yet established services through DAI, please contact them to engage in a confidential conversation about the process for requesting reasonable accommodations in the classroom. DAI can be reached by calling: 401-874-2098, visiting: web.uri.edu/disability, or emailing: dai@etal.uri.edu.  We are available to meet with students enrolled in Kingston as well as Providence courses.
```

```{card} Academic Enhancement Center
The Academic Enhancement Center (AEC) offers face-to-face and online services to undergraduate students seeking academic support. Services are based out of Roosevelt Hall, the Carothers Library room LL004, and online. Peer tutoring is available for STEM & BUS-related courses through the Drop-In Center and small-group tutoring. The Writing Center peer consultants offer feedback focused on supporting undergraduate writers at any stage of a writing assignment. The UCS 160 course and one-to-one Academic Skills Consultations offer strategies for improving studying and test-taking skills. Complete details about each of these programs, up-to-date schedules, contact information, and self-service study resources are all available on the AEC website, uri.edu/aec.

- STEM & BUS Tutoring helps undergraduate students navigate a variety of 100 and 200 level STEM & BUS courses through free peer tutoring in-person and online. Students can select occasional or weekly tutoring sessions through the TracCloud system or visit the Drop-In Center, located in the Carothers Library lower level room LL004. The TracCloud application is available through URI Microsoft 365 single sign-on and more detailed information and instructions can be found at uri.edu/aec/tutoring.

- Academic Skills Development courses and programs teach students how to plan and apply time management and study strategies. UCS 160: Success in Higher Education is a one-credit course on strategic approaches to planning and studying. UCS 161x: Becoming a Self Directed Student teaches strategies for taking greater control over their academic work and lives.  Academic Consultations are 1 to 1 meetings that help individual students to address their academic challenges. Students can schedule in-person or online consultations with David Hayes on Starfish. Study Your Way to Success is a self-guided web portal connecting students to tips and strategies on studying and time management related topics. For information or help with scheduling, contact Dr. Hayes directly at davidhayes@uri.edu. 


- The Undergraduate Writing Center provides peer writing support to students in any class, at any stage of the writing process: from understanding an assignment and brainstorming ideas, to developing, organizing, and revising a draft. Writing consultations are available through: 1) 25- or 50-minute in-person appointments, 2) synchronous online appointments, and 3) asynchronous written feedback. Synchronous appointments hosted by WCOnline are video-based, with audio, chat, document-sharing, and live captioning capabilities, to meet a range of accessibility needs. View availability and book online at uri.mywconline.com. For more information, visit uri.edu/aec/writing.
