## Course Description

`````````{div}
``` {card}

CSC 212 introduces fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms, and their role in organizing and processing information efficiently. The course explores theoretical, implementation, and application aspects of important data structures and algorithms in use on modern computers. Particular emphasis is given to algorithms for searching and sorting. The course also covers basic concepts for analyzing space and time requirements of algorithms, critical for understanding their performance characteristics. C/C++ is the programming language required for programming assignments and lab sessions.

_Prerequisites: C- or better in CSC 211; and MTH 180 or Computer Engineering major, and understanding the basics of programming in a higher level language such as C, Java, or Python. You should be familiar with classes, objects, methods, functions, loops, conditionals, arrays._

## Administrative

`````````{div}
``` {card} Academic Enhancement Center

Nearly all students recognize that regardless of how well or poorly they are doing in a given class, there are ways to improve their learning and studying. The Academic Enhancement Center (AEC) and Writing Center (WC), located in Roosevelt Hall, offers several kinds of support that help students improve their learning and academic performance in this class as well as other classes. For information on any of these programs, visit the AEC website or call the AEC’s main number at (401) 874-2367.

```

``` {card} Academic Honesty

General
: - Discussions with peers to gain more insights on coursework and lectures is strongly encouraged. However, when working on assignments, all written work and source code must be original. Students might not look at anyone's written solution. Copying another individual solution is plagiarism, a serious offense, and the one most common in computer science courses. Anyone that provides homework answers, source code for a programming assignment to another individual is also guilty of academic dishonesty. Students caught plagiarizing will be prosecuted in accordance with the University's Policy of Academic Honesty.

Advanced Automated Tools
: - Students are allowed to use advanced automated tools (artificial intelligence or machine learning tools such as ChatGPT or Dall-E 2) on assignments in this course if instructor permission is obtained in advance. Unless given permission to use those tools, each student is expected to complete each assignment without substantive assistance from others, including automated tools.  
: - If permission is granted to use advanced automated tools (artificial intelligence or machine learning tools such as ChatGPT or Dall-E 2), they must be properly documented and credited. Text generated using ChatGPT-3 should include a citation such as: “Chat-GPT-3. (YYYY, Month DD of query). “Text of your query.” Generated using OpenAI. https://chat.openai.com/” Material generated using other tools should follow a similar citation convention.  
: - If a tool is used in an assignment, students must also include a brief (2-3 sentences) description of how they used the tool.

```

``` {card} Disability Accommodations

Any student with a documented disability is welcome to contact me as early in the semester as possible, so that we may arrange reasonable accommodations. As part of this process, please be in touch with Disability, Access, and Inclusion Office.

```

``` {card} Religious Holidays

It is the policy of the University of Rhode Island to accord students, on an individual basis, the opportunity to observe their traditional religious holidays. Students desiring to observe a holiday of special importance must provide written notification to each instructor.
